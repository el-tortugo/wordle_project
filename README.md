# wordle_project
A simple wordle clone

Made using 100% Python, and several libraries including Wonderwords and Colorama

Generates a completely random word, and the player has 5 guesses to find the word. Each letter they get right changes color
within the terminal depending on whether or not it's in the right position.

Made by me, Kehinde Adeoso
